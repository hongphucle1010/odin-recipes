    <h1>Jamaican Beef Patties</h1>
    <p>These are a spicy, delicious snack that I first tried in London. They are a lot of work, but they are definitely worth it. You can also fill them with whatever you want, but I like the beef the best.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Add water and mix to form a dough. Knead dough until smooth, cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat shortening in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef and onion and cook until beef is evenly brown and onion is soft. Season with curry powder, cayenne pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir
            in bread crumbs and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Roll out dough to 1/8 inch thickness. Cut into 5 inch circles. Put a large spoonful of filling on half of each circle. Fold dough over filling and crimp edges to seal. Place on a lightly greased
            baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
